  <title>Search Function</title>
  <body>
    <p>The search function is available in the Navigator tab of each view (Text Corpus, Lemma,
      Thesaurus). </p>
    <p>In the toolbar of the Navigator click on the search icon <image
        href="Images/icons/full/icon16/search.png" id="image_ocz_zjs_4r"/>. A window will appear
      with an input field and two check boxes:</p>
    <p><image href="Images/new%20screenshots/BTS%20Screenshots/Search_Function.png"
        id="image_fkx_zr2_vt"/></p>
    <p>The search works as a full-text search. Therefore, the search is performed on the name of the
      database object, its metadata, and its textual data (i.e. the transliteration, translation
      etc.). Spaces and hyphens between words in the search field are interpreted as separate words.
      The search terms are combined with the operator OR, so when you search for Papyrus Westcar,
      the program will look for "Papyrus" and "Westcar" separately, and present you with results
      that contain Papyrus and/or Westcar. If you want to search for whole phrases you will have to
      put it between quotation marks "...", e.g. "Papyrus Westcar".</p>
    <p>When you want to locate a specific database object within a project there are two
      options:</p>
    <p>
      <ol id="ol_o4m_sv2_1v">
        <li>If you know the ID of a database object, enter the ID into the input field and activate
          the check box "Search for IDs". This will return only that database object; if you enter
          the same ID into a full text search, the search will return the child-elements of the
          database object with that ID.</li>
        <li>You can refine your search by activating the check box "Search for Names only". This
          makes the search only look at the names of database objects.</li>
      </ol>
    </p>
