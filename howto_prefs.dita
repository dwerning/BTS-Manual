    <p>To get to the "Preferences" window, click either the button <image
        href="Images/icons/full/icon16/preferences.png" id="image_ilm_dg1_nr"/> in the left part of
      the Toolbar menu or on the drop-down entry "<image
        href="Images/icons/full/icon16/preferences.png" id="image_svd_hg1_nr"/> Preferences..." in
      the Menu bar/Preferences. For more details see BTS User Interface, chapter <xref
        href="ui_preferences2.dita"/>.</p>
    <p/>
    <p>Expanding <b>"Berlin Text System General"</b> will present several options; those applicable
      to editing a text are the following:</p>
    <p><b>Corpus Settings</b></p>
    <p>Here you can choose the set of corpora you are going to work with. Every corpus that does not
      appear in the active corpora list on the right will not be accessed by BTS (this includes
      displaying them in the Navigator Tree and using them search queries). To activate a corpus
      select it in the list on the left and then click "Add". To remove the corpus from your working
      list, select it and click "Remove". "Add all"/"Remove all" will add or remove all available
      corpora to/from the active corpora list. </p>
    <p>The check-box "Activate to select main working corpus" has a specific function. If it is
      activated all new database objects created in the "Corpus Navigator" window will be physically
      saved in that corpus. E.g. in the Corpus Navigator you have selected Corpus 2, but your main
      working corpus is Corpus 1. The new database object will be <i>physically</i> saved in Corpus
      1, although in the Corpus Navigator it is displayed as a part of Corpus 2. See section on
      "Creating and modifying a database object".</p>
    <p>NOTE: You can only select a corpus as your "main working corpus" if you have the necessary
      rights to work in that corpus.</p>
    <p><b>Corpus Navigator Settings </b></p>
    <p>
      <ul id="ul_ndc_wl2_vt">
        <li>Check box "Corpus Navigator sort by sort key". By default, all database objects on the
          same level have "0" as a sort key and are thus sorted alphabetically. Changing the SortKey
          in the passport data of the database object will change its position in relation to other
          database objects, with "0" at the top. See Passport Editor, chapter <xref
            href="ui_maintab.dita"/>.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      <ul id="ul_egq_wl2_vt">
        <li>"Default Visibility" applies to all newly created database objects. It defines the
          visibility status a corpus will receive by default when it is created.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      <ul id="ul_fdd_xl2_vt">
        <li>"Default Review State" applies to all newly created database objects. Like "Default
          Visibility", this defines the review state a corpus will receive when it is created.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p><b>Lemma List Settings </b>
    </p>
    <p>Here you can choose a lemma list (from a project) as your main one. All new lemmata will be
      saved in this project. You can currently choose between "Altägyptisches Wörterbuch BBAW" and
      "Demotic". If you select both, the two lemma lists will be combined in the "Lemma Navigator".
      If you work with texts in Demotic script, please select "Demotic" as your main working lemma
      list, otherwise select "Altägyptisches Wörterbuch BBAW".</p>
    <p><b>Lemma Navigator Settings</b></p>
    <p>
      <ul id="ul_gvc_vl2_vt">
        <li>Check box "Lemma Navigator sort by sort key". By default all database objects on the
          same level have "0" as a sort key and are thus sorted alphabetically. Changing the
          "SortKey" in the passport data of the database object will change its position in relation
          to other database objects, with "0" at the top. </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      <ul id="ul_uy3_vl2_vt">
        <li>"Default Visibility" applies to all newly created database objects. It defines the
          visibility status a lemma will receive by default when it is created. See also chapter
            <xref href="user_roles.dita"/>.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      <ul id="ul_ylp_vl2_vt">
        <li>"Default Review State" applies to all newly created database objects. Like "Default
          Visibility", this defines the review state a lemma will receive when it is created.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>NOTE: "Default Visibility" and "Default Review State" apply to all newly created database
      objects, including annotations, rubra, comments etc. There is not currently a way of
      transferring a change in a parent element's Visibility or Review State to its child elements.
      This means that if your Default Visibility is "reader", you have to manually change all
      TCObjects, Texts, annotations, rubra etc. to "public" once you want to publish your text in
      the TLA.</p>
    <p><b>Lemmatizer</b>
    </p>
    <p>The Lemmatizer allows you to set a default inflection (the program's default inflection is
      "3") and activate the check box "Automatically select first lemma proposal". The latter
      feature allows you to navigate through the proposed lemmata via the arrow keys of your
      keyboard. For more on grammatical rules see <xref href="grammar_rules.dita"/>.</p>
    <p><b>Project settings</b>
    </p>
    <p>Here you can choose your main working project from the drop-down menu. The field below gives
      you an option to select further projects from which you want to load and read data. In the box
      on the left is a list of available projects. Clicking on one will give you an option to add it
      to the "Projects to be downloaded" on the right. Clicking on "Apply" below will download the
      project. Between the two fields you also have an option to remove the project from the right
      field, to "Add All" from available to "Projects to be downloaded", and "Remove All" from
      "Projects to be downloaded" to "Available Projects". Next to the "Apply" button there is also
      a button that will restore default settings "Restore Default".</p>
    <p><b>Remember me</b></p>
    <p>Select the check box "Remember my login credentials on startup" to be logged in automatically
      when starting BTS. To deactivate this function unselect the check box.</p>
    <p><b>Text Editor</b></p>
    <p>
      <ul id="ul_nwm_zl2_vt">
        <li>"Activate mouse-over pop-ups with information on lemmata" will display the lemmatization
          information about the selected lemma in the Text editor upon mouse-over.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      <ul id="ul_ewz_zl2_vt">
        <li>"Show line number ruler on left side". This check box activates the line numbering
          (according to the BTS window) in the <xref
            href="ui_texteditor_e10.dita#concept_f4v_hqm_mr">Text editor</xref>. </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p><b>Sign Text Editor </b></p>
    <p>Allows you to choose which elements are displayed in the lemma-boxes inside the Sign Text
      Editor. Additionally, the line width can be adjusted by changing the number in the "Line width
      in pixel" field (this function is currently unavailable).</p>
    <p>The applied changes will be visible once the "Sign Text Editor" tab has been refreshed. </p>
    <p><b>Thesaurus Settings</b>
    </p>
    <p>Here you can choose a main working thesaurus (from a project). All new thesaurus entries will
      be saved there. Currently only one working thesaurus is available: "Altägyptisches Wörterbuch
      BBAW".</p>
    <p><b>Thesaurus Navigator Settings</b></p>
    <p>
      <ul id="ul_dn2_bm2_vt">
        <li>Check box "Ths Navigator sort by sort key". By default all database objects on the same
          level have "0" as a sort key and are thus sorted alphabetically. Changing the "SortKey" in
          the passport data of the database object will change its position in relation to other
          database objects, with "0" at the top. </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      <ul id="ul_ojn_bm2_vt">
        <li>"Default Visibility" applies to all newly created database objects. It defines the
          visibility status a thesaurus entry will receive by default when it is created.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      <ul id="ul_mfc_cm2_vt">
        <li>"Default Review State" applies to all newly created database objects. Like "Default
          Visibility", this defines the review state a thesaurus entry will receive when it is
          created.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p/>
    <p>In the <b>"EgyDsl"</b> menu entry (Dsl = Domain Specific Language) you can change the
      appearance of your BTS. This includes applying different colours and scripts, as well as
      importing and editing templates.</p>
    <p><b>Syntax Coloring</b></p>
    <p>This feature does not work in the current version.</p>
    <p><b>Templates</b></p>
    <p>This window allows you to create templates to make the input of transliteration easier. For
      example, you can define short cuts for line counts. While transliterating, right-click and
      select "Content assist", and your template will be displayed at the end of the list. Double
      click it and it will be automatically inserted into the text. For a detailed description see
      chapter <xref href="howto_templates.dita"/>.</p>
    <p/>
    <p>GENERAL NOTE: To restore a default configuration, click the "Restore Default" button. To
      confirm your changes without closing the window click "Apply", to save and close click "OK".
      To reject all changes, click "Cancel".</p>
