  <title>Templates</title>

    <p>A template is a pattern used to replicate letters, shapes, or designs in word processing,
      e.g. line count, ambiguities, plural- and dual-endings etc. You can use this function to speed
      up the input of transliteration.</p>
    <p>Access the already-existing templates through the Content Assist (right-click in the Text
      Editor Transliteration field or press CTRL + Spacebar and choose it from the menu). The
      already-existing templates are essentially what you can find on the keyboard layout and type
      manually. Depending on the position of your cursor (i.e. is it within a sentence/word or
      outside a sentence marked by §§) you will get a different set of templates to choose from.
      This is helpful if you are ever unsure about what can be inserted in a given position in the
      transliteration. In the example below, the position is in line 3, where no §§ have been added
      yet, hence the Content Assist gives you only one option: to enter §. </p>

      /></p>

    <p><b>Creating a new template</b></p>
    <p>Select "Preferences" in the Menu bar, then expand "EgyDsl" and click on the entry
      "Templates". Clicking on "New..." will open a new window where you have to name your template
      and select its context from the drop-down menu; the context determines the position in the
      text in which this template can be displayed (i.e. SentenceItem or WordPart). </p>
    <p>NOTE: Use "SentenceItem" for independent items (e.g. line count) and "WordPart" for dependent
      items (e.g. plural and dual endings). All other contexts should not be used.</p>
    <p>You can add a short description to your template to explain what it does; this is not
      mandatory. The template's name and description will be displayed in the Content Assist. In the
      field "Pattern" enter the text which will be entered into the transliteration. The button
      "Insert Variable..." allows you to choose from some pre-set patterns which you can use for
      your template. The example below demonstrates how a template works: </p>
    <p><image href="Images/new%20screenshots/BTS%20Screenshots/Template2.png" id="image_gjh_wq2_1v"
      /></p>
    <p>When you are finished, click OK and the template will appear in the list and is ready to be
      used (you can edit or remove it at a later date if you want to). Right-click within the §§
      signs and open the Content Assist (CTRL + Spacebar). Scroll to the bottom where the new
      template is located (using either the mouse or the arrow keys). Clicking on it once will
      display the pattern which will be inserted to the text; double-clicking (or ENTER) will add
      the template to the transliteration. </p>
