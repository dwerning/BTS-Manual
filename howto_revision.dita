  <title>Revision History / Conflict Dialogue</title>
  <body>
    <p><b>Revision History</b></p>
    <p>By right-clicking on a database object or by clicking Edit/Open Revision History <image
        href="Images/icons/full/icon16/history.png" id="image_cck_fs4_kx"/> in the Menu bar, you can
      open the revision history of the selected database object in order to compare different
      versions and to restore a previous version.</p>
    <p>The Revision History window is divided into two parts. The left side displays the master
      version, i.e. the current version. The right side shows the previous saved versions ("Select
      Compare Version").</p>
    <p>In the lower part there are the usual tabs, e.g. Passport Editor and Egyptian Text Editor,
      for the database object. Select a past version by left-clicking to compare it to the current
      version. You can navigate between the tabs to see the changes made in the respective
      versions.</p>
    <p>NOTE: The topmost version on the right is the latest one.</p>
    <p>To restore a previous version (which will overwrite the current version), right-click it in
      the list and apply "Replace current with Selected Revision".</p>
    <p>Close the Revision History window by clicking "Close".</p>
    <p><b>Conflict Dialog</b></p>
    <p>If two users work simultaneously on one database object, it is possible, that they produce
      different versions at the same time. This is indicated by the icon <image
        href="Images/icons/full/ovr16/conflicts-small.png" id="image_av1_g24_kx"/> in the Navigator
      tree. The conflict dialog solves the problem, which version is the preferable one.</p>
    <p>The window is divided into two parts (as for the Revision History). The left side displays
      the current version. The right side shows the conflicting versions.</p>
    <p>In the lower part there are the respective tabs, e.g. Passport Editor and Egyptian Text
      Editor for a text. Select a conflicting version by left-click and compare it to the current
      version. You can navigate between the tabs to see the changes made in the respective versions. </p>
    <p>To remove a conflicting version, right-click it in the list and apply "Remove Conflicting
      Revision".</p>
    <p>NOTE: Due to technical reasons it might take several attempts to get to the "Remove
      Conflicting Revision" button.</p>
    <p>Apply your changes by clicking "Save and Close" or reject them by clicking "Cancel".</p>
