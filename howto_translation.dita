 <title>Translation</title>
 <conbody>
  <p>You can enter the translation of individual sentences in the field "Sentence translation" of
            the Text Editor. This window will remain deactivated (greyed out) during
            transliteration, and until you press the button <image
                href="Images/icons/full/icon16/lemma-load.png" id="image_ynz_vnc_xt"/> "Load Text
            Lemmata" or you have switched between the Text Editor and the Sign Text Editor tabs.</p>
  <p>Make sure you have selected the right language in the drop-down menu on the right (<image
                href="Images/icons/full/icon16/locale.png" id="image_krw_wmv_nr"/>): German (de),
            English (en), French (fr), Spanish (es), Italian (it), Arabic (ar), or Russian (ru). The
            default language can be set in the <xref href="ui_preferences.dita">Preferences</xref>. </p>
        <p>In the standard view only one line of text will be visible. You can extend the Text
            Editor window and scroll up/down if the sentence contains more than one line. The
            complete translation of the text will appear on the right of your BTS screen in the
            "Text translation" section (this usually needs refreshing, e.g. by clicking in the
            Corpus Navigator and reopening the selected text). Clicking on a sentence here will
            highlight it and the corresponding transliterated sentence will be underlined in the
            "Transliteration" subsection. You will have to enter the translation sentence by
            sentence. </p>
        <p>Within an ancient Egyptian grammatical sentence, it is possible to segment the modern
            translation by using the ENTER key. Enter only one translation for each sentence; the
            choice of language is not intended for multilingual translations of a single text.</p>
        <p>We recommend entering a readable and understandable translation in the modern language,
            while still maintaining the meaning of the ancient text.</p>
        <p><b>Using transliteration signs in the translation</b></p>
        <p>You can use transliteration signs in your translation. This might be necessary if there
            are only traces of a word preserved or if there is no translation available, e.g.
                "<i>jꜣ.t</i>-tree". In this case, write the transliteration between two "$" signs so
            that the system knows to transform the text into cursive in the TLA, e.g.:
            $jꜣ.t$-tree.</p>
        <p/>
        <p>NOTE: Before you enter your translation, make sure that the relevant sentence is active.
            This is indicated by the sign <image href="Images/icons/full/icon16/locale.png"
                id="image_szd_1fs_2x"/> in the Text Editor directly to the left of the relevant
            sentence. It might take some time or a switch between database objects, before the
            sentence is activated. If the sign does not show up, your translation will not be saved
            (compare note on <xref href="howto_transliteration.dita">Copy with Lemmata</xref>
            above). </p>
