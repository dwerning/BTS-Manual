 <title>Inversions</title>
 <conbody>
  <p><i>When the inverted words form a single lemma</i> enter the sign-sequence as it appears in the
      script, e.g. in the title <i>ḥm-nṯr</i> or the preposition <i>ḫft</i> which is usually written
      with <i>t</i> before <i>f</i>.</p>
  <p><i>When the inverted words do not form a single lemma</i>, e.g. an inverted writing of <i>mj
        Rꜥw</i>, encode each word with the signs that belong to it. The inverted sign-sequence
      cannot be reproduced/depicted with the hieroglyphs, but use the option "Select Single Glyph"
      to mark such inversions (see below).</p>
  <p><i>When the inversion occurs while the word boundaries are broken</i>, e.g. <image
        href="Images/Hypszer/Handbuch-Screenschots/Hieros.jpg" id="image_hdj_gzt_mr"/> ,the signs
      have to be assigned to the words they belong to (in this case V30+G7 and I9 separately). The
      inverted sign-sequence cannot be reproduced/depicted with the hieroglyphs, but use the option
      "Select Single Glyph" to mark such inversions (see below).</p>
    <p><b>Select Single Glyphs</b></p>
  <p>This function is available for the last two types of inversions. To mark the correct position
      of G7's determinative, select it using the buttons |&lt;, &lt;, >, and >|. The selected sign
      will be marked red. After that set the "Order in Sentence" to the position where the sign
      occurs in the manuscript. Then do the same with the I9 sign. In the example below G7 and I9
      have to switch to positions 7 and 6 accordingly. </p>
