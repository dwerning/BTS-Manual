  <title>Editing passport data </title>
  <body>
    <p>The Passport Editor is located in the bottom centre of the Text Corpus view. It is essential
      that you enter the metadata of your TCObjects, Texts, Subtexts, and Glosses correctly, since
      only complete and accurate metadata will allow effective search queries and statistical
      evaluation of the data.</p>
    <p>Most entries in the passport data are controlled by thesaurus lists. These lists are composed
      of controlled vocabulary, such as dates, locations, provenances, etc. </p>
    <p>Only select entries from the thesauri if you are certain that they are correct. If a fact is
      uncertain select "unbekannt" or "unbestimmt". You can always discuss questionable facts, e.g.
      the findspot of an ancient Egyptian object or the date of a text, in the Comment fields.</p>
    <p>The thesauri are not complete yet. In case a Thesaurus entry you need is missing, please send
      a proposal to the BTS team in Berlin: aegypt1@bbaw.de.</p>
