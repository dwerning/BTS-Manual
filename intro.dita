 <title>Introduction</title>
 <conbody>
  <p>Welcome to Berlin Text System V 3.0 - a new Java software with a Couch DB database and an
   Elastic search engine, designed for editing and annotating Ancient Egyptian texts. Entering texts
   into the <b>Text Editor</b> allows the texts to be annotated in different layers; one of the main
   functions of the system is the lexical and grammatical annotation of words in texts. Using an
   integrated lemmatizer, all words are connected to the appropriate entries in the <b>Lemma
    List</b>, which is constantly updated and contains all known words of the Ancient Egyptian
   vocabulary. Furthermore, all texts (here called 'database objects') can be enriched with
   metadata, such as provenance, materiality, and date, which can be selected from a controlled
   vocabulary of <b>Thesauri</b>. Additionally, in the <b>Abstract Text</b> function the different
   textual witnesses of a text can be combined in one view, showing the text's development over
   time.</p>
  <p>The four major components - Text Editor, Lemma List, Thesaurus, and Abstract Text are briefly
   described below:</p>
  <p>
   <ul id="ul_wqg_qyb_lx">
    <li>The <b>Text Editor</b> provides tools for transliteration, translation, lemmatization
     (assigning a lemma to a word), entering hieroglyphic transcriptions via a Hieroglyph Type
     Writer, and annotations. Texts can be merged and arranged in a Text Corpus. The Text Editor is
     the core of the BTS. </li>
   </ul>
   <ul id="ul_g1g_ryb_lx">
    <li>The <b>Lemma List</b> contains two up-to-date lists of Pre-Coptic lemmata separated into
     words from Hieroglyphic and Hieratic scripts, and those in Demotic script. These lists are
     accessible to any BTS user. Each lemma has passport data, transliteration, and translation, as
     well as annotations and comments.</li>
   </ul>
   <ul id="ul_hsx_zyb_lx">
    <li>The <b>Thesaurus</b> contains vocabulary which is used for the metadata of the database
     objects, such as date, location, provenance etc. A controlled vocabulary for metadata is
     necessary to maintain data consistency and effective search functions. All terms in the
     thesaurus reflect a semantic network of concepts including parent/child relationships.
     Thesaurus entries are offered in the Passport Editor section of either the Text Editor in the
     Text Corpus View or the Lemma Editor in the Lemma view.</li>
   </ul>
   <ul id="ul_yzc_tzb_lx">
    <li>The <b>Abstract Text</b> connects all versions of a text with a long textual tradition; this
     function is currently unavailable.</li>
   </ul>
  </p>
  <p/>
  <p>This User Manual provides an overview of the features in BTS. </p>
  <p>
   <ul id="ul_lwg_xy1_pt">

     step-by-step instructions for installing BTS and its initial configuration. It also includes a
     description of the different user roles. </li>
   </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
   <ul id="ul_a1f_mz1_pt">
    <li>The <b>General User Guide</b> provides a basic introduction to BTS and explains how to edit
     an Ancient Egyptian text.</li>
   </ul>
   <ul id="ul_ebg_l1c_lx">
    <li>The <b>Guide for advanced and privileged users</b> shows users with the necessary editing
     rights how to edit the lemma list and the thesaurus entries, and contains information for
     administrators and editors.</li>
