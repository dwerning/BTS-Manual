  <title>Toolbar </title>
  <body>
    <p>The Toolbar displays several icons. ToolTips are displayed upon the mouse-over.</p>
    <p><image href="Images/new%20screenshots/BTS%20Screenshots/Toolbar_complete.png"
        id="image_rvd_tjp_5t"/></p>
    <p><image href="Images/icons/full/obj16/add.png" id="image_izv_hlr_4r"/>
      <u>New</u>
    </p>
    <p>Click the black triangle on the right of the plus sign to open a context menu.</p>
    <p>Here you can choose between the entries to create a new corpus, a new text corpus object, a
      new text or an annotation. As long as you did not select a corpus in the Navigator window the
      entries in the menu are disabled. </p>
    <p><image href="Images/icons/full/icon16/save-all.png" id="image_n2f_tlr_4r"/>
      <u>Save</u>
    </p>
    <p>Save the changes you made in the currently active database object. As long as you did not
      work in the database object it will be inactive (grey) and after saving it will return to the
      inactive state. If you attempt to close the program the window will ask you to save your
      changes unless you already have done a save before. </p>
    <p>NOTE There is no autosave in BTS 3.0, but the program will save your file after
      opening/displaying/switching to a different database object. Make sure you save your work in
      regular intervals to avoid loss of input!</p>
    <p><image href="Images/icons/full/icon16/save.png" id="image_vgj_tmr_4r"/>
      <u>Save all </u></p>
    <p>Save all changes in all the database objects you have worked on.</p>

      <u>Undo (Ctrl+Z)</u>
    </p>
    <p>Undo the last action. You can undo more than one action. You have to be in the same view
      where you made your changes (same transliteration, translation etc.). Corpora/objects/texts
      created accidentally cannot be deleted this way.</p>
    <p><image href="Images/icons/full/icon16/redo.png" id="image_ffc_mnr_4r"/>
      <u>Redo</u>
    </p>
    <p>Reverse last "undone" action.</p>
    <p><image href="Images/icons/full/icon16/preferences.png" id="image_rkn_4nr_4r"/>

      Settings. </p>

      of the current project.</p>

        id="image_wvw_mkp_5t"/>
      <u>Abstract Text</u> are all views which you can open by clicking on their respective icon on
      the toolbar.</p>
    <p><u>NOTE</u>: The Abstract Text feature is not complete yet. It will compile the witnesses of
      a single text (e.g. Sinuhe) and deliver a generic structure, ex. display the concordance of
      paragraphs. The metadata concerning the "abstract text" can be entered here, e.g. the
      bibliography. </p>
