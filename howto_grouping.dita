 <title>Grouping hieroglyphs</title>
 <conbody>
  <p>Grouping hieroglyphs is a useful, but not an essential, task of the text editing process.
      Encoding the grouping enables analyses on the strategies and use of grouping in texts.
      However, whether you encode the grouping or not, it is essential that you enter the
      hieroglyphs in the right sequence because this is crucial for all further analyses of the data
      and for searches for words by the order of hieroglyphic signs (e.g. if you find a sequence of
      two hieroglyphs in a damaged text and want to look for words that could fit the lacuna). For
      details on the encoding of hieroglyphs and hieroglyphic groups see <xref
        href="guidelines_hieroglyphs.dita"/>.</p>
  <p><b>1. If you decide not to group hieroglyphs</b>, use a hyphen between the single hieroglyphs
      and encode the signs according to their sequence in the text. For the BTS sequence conventions
      see chapter 2.1 <xref href="Hieroglypheneingabe_Richtlinien.pdf" format="pdf"><image

        the encoding of hieroglyphs</xref>.</p>
  <p><b>2. If you group hieroglyphs</b>, you can also use ":" and "*". Grouping with "&amp;" is not
      allowed, because this alters the sequence of hieroglyphs, e.g. "d&amp;D" would produce the
      correct appearance of the hieroglyphic group but it would imply the sequence "d-D" for
      analyses in the database. Furthermore, it is crucial that you work with the photos or a
      facsimile of the original text. Publications containing hand- or computer-written hieroglyphs
      may show the hieroglyphs in a different order than the original text. If neither a photo nor a
      facsimile of your text is available, please refrain from grouping the hieroglyphs. </p>
